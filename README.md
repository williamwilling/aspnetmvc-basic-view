#ASP.NET MVC: Basic view

It's inconvenient to [return all your HTML as a string](https://github.com/williamwilling/aspnetmvc-basic-controller "ASP.NET MVC - Basic controller"). To separate your HTML from the code in your controller, you use a view.

##Exploring the code

The file `Controllers\GreetingsController.cs` contains the code that calls the views. The views themselves are in the folder `Views`.

If you want to try and implement a basic view yourself, you can check out the `start`-branch, which is the starting point for this example.
